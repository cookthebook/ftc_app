# FTC App without Android Studio
  This fork of `ftc_app` aims to provide good installation scripts for Linux more up-to-date dependencies for the Android app.

## Why?
  I don't like Android Studio.

  I personally think VS Code is the best IDE, but regardless you shouldn't be forced into Google's IDE just to build your app.

  But, installing everything necessary can be a complicated/tedious task, so I aim to provide a good installer tool written in Python.
